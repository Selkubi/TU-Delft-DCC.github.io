#### Code Coverage
Code coverage measures how much of your code is executed during testing. It is a useful metric to ensure that your tests are comprehensive and indicate your code's quality. If your software becomes a dependency for others, a code coverage of 70% or higher is recommended for unit tests.

::: {.panel-tabset}
## Python
- [pytest-cov plugin](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) (for pytest)
- [Coverage.py documentation](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## MATLAB
- [Collect code coverage with Command Window execution](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/runtests.html#d126e1481788) *(since R2023b)*
- [Code coverage with Test Browser](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/testbrowser-app.html#:~:text=Generate%20Code%20Coverage%20Report) *(since R2023a)*
- [Collect code coverage metrics](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/collect-statement-and-function-coverage-metrics-for-matlab-source-code.html)
:::

#### Error handling
Tests should check if your code behaves as expected when it encounters errors.


- MATLAB - [Verify function throws specific exceptions](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.unittest.qualifications.verifiable.verifyerror.html)
- Pytest - [Assert raised exceptions](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/assert.html#assertraises)

Example in Python:
```python
def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
    return x / y

def test_divide_by_zero():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        divide(1, 0)
```

#### Fixtures 
Fixtures are predefined states or sets of data used to set up the testing environment, ensuring consistent conditions for tests to run reliably.
    
- MATLAB - [Create shared fixtures](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/write-test-using-shared-fixtures.html)
- Pytest - [How to use fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/fixtures.html)
    
#### Parameterization
Parameterization involves running the same test with different inputs or configurations to ensure broader coverage and identify potential edge cases.
    
- MATLAB - [Create a basic parameterized test](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-basic-parameterized-test.html)
- Pytest - [Parameterizing unit tests](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/22-scaling-up-unit-testing/index.html#parameterising-our-unit-tests)


#### Mocking
Mocking is a technique used to simulate the behavior of dependencies or external systems during testing, allowing isolated testing of specific components. For example, if your software requires a connection to a database, you can *mock* this interaction during testing.

![MATLAB Mocking Diagram](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/mocking_overview.png)

- MATLAB - [Create Mock Object](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-mock-object.html)
- Pytest - [How to monkeypatch/mock modules and environments](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/monkeypatch.html)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"} 
## üêí Ethymology of monkeypatching
The term monkey patch seems to have come from an earlier term, guerrilla patch, which referred to changing code sneakily ‚Äì and possibly incompatibly with other such patches ‚Äì at runtime. The word guerrilla, nearly homophonous with gorilla, became monkey, possibly to make the patch sound less intimidating.

#### Marks and tags
You can use test tags to group tests into categories and then run tests with specified tags.

- MATLAB - [Tag unit tests](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/tag-unit-tests.html)
- Pytest - [Working with custom markers](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/example/markers.html)


#### Specific library tests
In Python, some libraries come with their own specific test assertions, often compatible with `pytest`. For example, numpy includes a set of assertions for testing a `numpy.ndarray`. For more information, check out [Numpy Test Support](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.testing.html).
