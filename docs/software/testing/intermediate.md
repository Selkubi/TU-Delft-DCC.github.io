#### Code Coverage
A code coverage report is a tool to measure the effectiveness of testing by providing insights into which parts of the codebase have been executed during testing. 

- MATLAB - [Collect code coverage with Command Window execution](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/runtests.html#d126e1481788) *(since R2023b)*
- MATLAB - [Code coverage with Test Browser](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/testbrowser-app.html#:~:text=Generate%20Code%20Coverage%20Report) *(since R2023a)*
- MATLAB - [Collect code coverage](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/collect-statement-and-function-coverage-metrics-for-matlab-source-code.html)
- Pytest -  [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/)
- Python coverage - [Documentation](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

#### Error handling
It is not only useful to test that your code generates the expected behaviour for the appropriate inputs, it is also useful to check that your functions throw the correct exceptions when this is not the case.

- MATLAB - [Verify function throws specific exceptions](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/matlab.unittest.qualifications.verifiable.verifyerror.html)
- Pytest - [Assert raised exceptions](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/assert.html#assertraises)

#### Fixtures 
Fixtures are predefined states or sets of data used to set up the testing environment, ensuring consistent conditions for tests to run reliably.
    
- MATLAB - [Create shared fixtures](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/write-test-using-shared-fixtures.html)
- Pytest - [How to use fixtures](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/how-to/fixtures.html)
    
#### Parameterization
Parameterization involves running the same test with different inputs or configurations to ensure broader coverage and identify potential edge cases.
    
- MATLAB - [Create a basic parameterized test](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/create-basic-parameterized-test.html)
- Pytest - [Parameterizing unit tests](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/python-intermediate-development/22-scaling-up-unit-testing/index.html#parameterising-our-unit-tests)


#### Mocking
Mocking is a technique used to simulate the behavior of dependencies or external systems during testing, allowing isolated testing of specific components. For example, if your software requires a connection to a database, you can *mock* this interaction during testing.

- Pytest - [How to monkeypatch/mock modules and environments](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/monkeypatch.html)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"} 
## üêí Ethymology of monkeypatching
The term monkey patch seems to have come from an earlier term, guerrilla patch, which referred to changing code sneakily ‚Äì and possibly incompatibly with other such patches ‚Äì at runtime. The word guerrilla, nearly homophonous with gorilla, became monkey, possibly to make the patch sound less intimidating.

#### Marks and tags
You can use test tags to group tests into categories and then run tests with specified tags.

- MATLAB - [Tag unit tests](https://nl.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/tag-unit-tests.html)
- Pytest - [Working with custom markers](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/example/markers.html)


#### Specific library tests
In Python, some libraries come with their own specific test assertions, often compatible with `pytest`. For example, numpy includes a set of assertions for testing a `numpy.ndarray`. For more information, check out [Numpy Test Support](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.testing.html).
