When depositing data, selecting an appropriate license is a crucial step, as it defines the permissions and restrictions for others using your data. Clear labelling of licensing terms ensures that data can be shared and reused ethically and legally. 
If your data includes accompanying software, it is important to license the software separately to clearly define its usage rights distinct from the data.

For more detailed information on data licenses, please visit the [4TU.ResearchData Licensing Guide](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/use/publish-cite/upload-your-data-in-our-data-repository/licencing) or read on [Data Licenses](https://book.the-turing-way.org/reproducible-research/licensing/licensing-data) in The Turing Way book. You can also use [Creative Commons License Chooser](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) to help you select a license.
