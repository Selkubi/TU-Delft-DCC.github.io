Data repositories are where research data can be stored for long term preservation. When data is published in a repository, it is often assigned a digital object identifier (DOI), which ensures that the data is discoverable and accessible over time.
When published, the data should be accompanied by an appropriate license and metadata describing your data.

### {{< fa exclamation >}} Important
If you would like to publish your data collection in 4TU.ResearchData or in another data repository, it is advisable that you discuss the publishing process, including the reuse and [citation](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/research-data-management/r/publish/cite-your-data) of the original datasets and appropriate [licensing](https://data.4tu.nl/info/en/use/publish-cite/upload-your-data-in-our-data-repository/licencing) options with your faculty [data steward](https://www.tudelft.nl/library/research-data-management/r/support/data-stewardship/contact).

## 4TU.ResearchData

Choosing a repository for publishing your data depends on factors such as storage costs, funding or publication requirements, and security needs. TU Delft provides an in-house data repository, [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/), supporting **data version control** and **Github integration** as part of their services. Additionally, when publishing your data, your metadata is reviewed to ensure that repository requirements are met.  

## Zenodo

Developed by CERN, [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) is a user-friendly platform designed to facilitate open access to research data and software. The platform offers **data version control**, allowing researchers to track changes and updates to their datasets over time. Additionally, it **integrates seamlessly with GitHub**, enabling developers to archive and cite their repositories easily.
