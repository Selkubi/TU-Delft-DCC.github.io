# Contributing to DCC guides

## What to Include in a "How to guide"
Guides that take the reader thru the steps required to solve a ** speficic-common problem**. How to guides are problem oriented.

For example:
- A series of steps to solve a problem
- An answer addressing and specific question (not for beginners)
- Tell users how to reach an goal or end

> **Important** focus on telling the user how to reach a goal. Practical usability is more important than completeness (don't aim to explain every casr). A good name matters, so be as short as possible but without loosing specifity and meaning. 


# What NOT to Include:

- Unnecessary explanations, those belog to the Discussion part.
- Technical descriptions, those belong to the 'Reference part' which might be implemented in the future.
- Tutorials
